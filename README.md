# Connect-4

The goal of this project is to create a Connect Four bot that can play intelligently against a human player. 
The bot will analyze the game state and make moves that increase its chances of winning. The bot uses a heuristic function to determine the score of a game state based on the number of chips that are connected in a row, column, or diagonal. The heuristic function assigns a high value to four chips connected in a row, and a negative or positive sign based on the color of the chips. 
The bot uses the MinMax algorithm, with alpha-beta pruning, to find the best possible move. 
The algorithm is designed to search up to a depth of 5 moves in reasonable time.
